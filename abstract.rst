:Bio:            Olivier Debeir achieved his PhD in Applied Sciences from the 
                 Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles in 2002. His research interest 
                 deals with image processing and analysis, pattern recognition 
                 in particular multi-classifier systems, all of these mainly 
                 applied to bio-medical imaging and remote sensing. 
                 He his Assistant Professor at the same institution for 
                 lectures on image processing and image analysis. 
                 He was involved in the conversion to Python as main 
                 programming language for Bachelors at the Ecole 
                 Polytechnique de Bruxelles.

:Description:    This tutorial is a hands-on introduction to the two most basic
                 building-blocks of the scientific Python stack: the enhanced
                 interactive interpreter IPython and the fast numerical
                 container Numpy. Amongst other things you will learn how to
                 structure an interactive workflow for scientific computing and
                 how to create and manipulate numerical data efficiently. You
                 should have some basic familiarity with Python (variables,
                 loops, functions) and basic command-line usage (executing
                 commands, using history).
:Outline:        **Python** 

                 * Why Python ?
                 * Python language basics
                 * What do we need to starts with scentific python              

                 **let's solve some scientific questions...**

                 * Basic data processing
                 * Some plotting
                 * Interfacing you computer whith the real world

                 The tutorial will feature short interactive session.

:Package List:   An install of `Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/>`_ should
                 be enough

                 * Numpy (Version 1.6 or higher)
                 * Ipython (Version 0.13 or higher)
                 * Matplotlib (Version 1.2.1 or higher)
