Dependencies
--------------

* Anaconda: https://store.continuum.io/

* In case of no network: grab one of the three USB-Keys

  * They read *XXXXX*


* to test serial interaction the python serial module should be installed (not needed for the tutorial)

About The Speaker
-----------------

* `Olivier Debeir <http://lisa.ulb.ac.be>`_ from Brussels, Belgium
* image processing professor at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles
* main research interest topics are biomedical image processing and pattern recognition
* not a python ninja but rather a **Python enthousiast**

Outline of this tutorial
-------------------------

* introduction to Python language

* some practical examples     

* demo of an interface with the real world


Audience interaction
-------------------------------

* during the tutorial interaction will be required from the audience, 

* an interactive tool should be available during the session at a given IP address (see low tech board), 

* be sure to have a webpage open at the given address (eventually refresh the page for each new question)


* test : open a webpage at the given address: http:/XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:8000
    
* answer the following question:
    * A: Yeah it works !
    * B: No, it does not :-( 

About the Material
------------------

* **Python**

  * An IPython notebook demonstrating the Python language basics
  * A demo of different tools available in a scientific python environment 


* **Examples**

  * IPython notebooks

How to Follow
-------------

* to start just follow the presentation

* after the general introduction on Python, you should be familiar with the environement and proceed with the following:

* grab the IPython notebook, try out the examples, work on the exercises, all
  from within the notebook.

* to start an interactive IPython session use the following command line:

  .. sourcecode:: console

     $ ipython notebook --pylab=inline

.. raw:: latex

   \vspace{1cm}

* Alternatively: view the HTML and copy and paste the examples into an IPython
  shell or a Python file.

* remark : 

    exemples related to the serial interaction will of course not be functional (some specific HW is required here)
